# PriCalc

No juj plez, this project is in the "just get something done and clean it up later" phase

## Data setup

Paste master.db from datamine to src/data/master.db and run `npm run dump-db`

## Philosophy and Goals

 * *Enable enjoyment* - PriCalc is intended to be a tool that enables players to do their own analysis. I find overanalyzing games to be fun, and I'm hoping this tool will allow people to have fun in the same way.
 * *Desktop-first* - Although many players of a phone game are likely to visit this app on their phone, the tools will be designed on a desktop screen size first, and then made to fit in a mobile UI later. I find that mobile UIs are often overly simplistic, and I don't ever want to feel like I can't display all the data I want to because I can't fit it in the UI. That's not to say the mobile UI isn't important - it should be usable, but power users should be able to use a rich desktop UI.
