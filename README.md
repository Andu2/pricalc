# PriCalc

No juj plez, this project is in the "just get something done and clean it up later" phase

## Data setup

Paste master.db from datamine to src/data/master.db and run `npm run dump-db`

## Philosophy and Goals

 * *Enable enjoyment* - PriCalc is intended to be a tool that enables players to do their own analysis. I find overanalyzing games to be fun, and I'm hoping this tool will allow people to have fun in the same way.
