# PriCalc

## Data setup

Paste master.db from datamine to src/data/master.db and run `npm run dump-db`

## Philosophy and Goals

 * *Enable enjoyment* - PriCalc is intended to be a tool that enables players to do their own analysis. I find overanalyzing games to be fun, and I'm hoping this tool will allow people to have fun in the same way.

## Ideas

 * notification quiz - who says it
